- **Name Box** → Shows the cell address (e.g., A1).  
- **Worksheet Tabs** → Multiple sheets in one file (Sheet1, Sheet2...).  
- **Status Bar** → Displays info (e.g., Average, Count, Sum of selected cells).

## 6. Basic Formulas & Functions

### Formulas (manual):
- Addition → `=A1 + B1`  
- Subtraction → `=A1 - B1`  
- Multiplication → `=A1 * B1`  
- Division → `=A1 / B1`  

### Functions (predefined):
- Sum → `=SUM(A1:A5)`  
- Average → `=AVERAGE(A1:A5)`  
- Max → `=MAX(A1:A5)`  
- Min → `=MIN(A1:A5)`  
- Count → `=COUNT(A1:A5)`  

 *Practice:* Enter marks of 5 students → Find Total, Average, Highest, Lowest.

## 7. Saving & Managing Workbooks

- **Save (Ctrl + S):** Saves file.  
- **Save As:** Save with a new name/location.  

### File Types:
- `.xlsx` → Default Excel format.  
- `.xls` → Older Excel format.
